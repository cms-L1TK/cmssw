## Overview

In this folder of this branch, there are numerous plotting scripts that are useful for debugging different versions of the Kalman Filter. Below is a table that names the code, gives and example, and a short description. You can find each code in this folder. Each code has some instructions on how to use it in the beginning.

## Codes

| Code Name | Example | Description |
| ----------| ------- | ----------- |
| res_vs_eta_seeds_and_num.C | ![image](https://github.com/cms-L1TK/cmssw/assets/71595540/20e0927b-4db8-4080-ad0a-85fd03634c9c) ![image](https://github.com/cms-L1TK/cmssw/assets/71595540/4a0aaffb-17d0-4b82-a078-d5921f782efe) | Creates two plots. One of them is resolution of z0 plotted against absolute eta separated by seed type. The second is the number of tracks against eta per seed type. |
